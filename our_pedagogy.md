including staffing, logistics, timing, and engagement.  The

## Delivery Guidlines
MEETX courses are:
1. High-energy
2. Interactive
3. Collaborative
4. Introduce relevant and challenging material
5. Fun

1. High-Energy
Teachers convey genuine enthusiasm and passion for subjects
Consistently create space to talk about why a certain subject is not just important but awesome (in the truest sense of the word...awe-inspring)
Encourage and reinforce participation

2. Interactive
-5-min rule: Teachers never speak for more than 5 minutes at a time
-Every 5 minute block should bookend with an 'interactive practice' or other *CFU*
-Use CFUs REGULARLY


3.  ALWAYS use names + Personal details 
  - To cold call
  - To reinforce positive behavior in front of the class (eg. 'Did everyone hear Laura's insight?  Laura can you repeat?  or Steve can you summarize what Laura said and possibly add?'
  - To gently state need from a student in front of class 'eg. Tommy we need you to wrap up and give your attention to Lisa.'
  - In written curriculum examples (eg. 'Jerry.dance = "true"')
  - In impromptu examples/metaphors (eg. 'Ok let's try another example of real-world functions.  We all know Jerry is an amazing dancer.  Jerry — can you break down the steps of the 'duggy?')

*CFUs*
Checks for understanding are a key tactic for 
1. Introducing interacitivty into a lesson
2. Giving teacher as much 'early signaling' as possible to course correct — either academically or engagement-wise

Examples:
1. Thumbs
2. Arm-barometers
3. Think-pair-share
4. Turn-to-partner
5. Cold-calling
6. Whiteboard display (count of 3)
7. Peer Instruction
8. Fist-to-5
9. Timed Pair Share
10. The ConcepTest consists of a challenging conceptual question or problem posed in
multiple-choice format. Students turn to a partner seated nearby and they work together to reach a
common answer
for a given amount of time, taking turns (A talks, B listens, then B talks, A listens)

Content is always
- interactive
- question/cliffhanger driven
- hook-forward 
- topical
- diverse appeal
