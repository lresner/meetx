## I. Overview

JD Intro.

The potentially high reward of MEETx model comes at great dificulty of execution.  

## II. MEETx Outcomes


What are the ideal outcomes for a MEETx Y1 graduate?
1. They will attend every class
2. Enthusiastic
3. Prepared to succeed in S2


## III. Keys to Success

Year-long (ie after-school) programs face enormous challenges, including staffing, logistics, timing, and engagement.  These challenges are layered on top of an already ambitious academci and social component of MEET.  In order to be successful, the following are critical:
1. Top-notch teachers.  Teachers who excel not only at relationship and rapport building with students, but that are also skilled in the craft of delivering engaging, topical, interactive lessons.  Given the startup nature of MEETx, they must also be inclined to iterate and experiment rapidly in order to refine the delivery model until its successful.
2. Content suited to online delivery.  Content that is hook-heavy, topical, interactive, and collaborative.  
3. Delivery
4. Community.  Students must feel invested in the overall success of the MEETx experiment, as well as the success and well-being of each other.  This set of cultural expectations should be set over the summer and continuously reinforced throughout the year with a mix of internal (eg. "You are pioneers of a program that could only exapns MEETs impact, but have have a global impact as well.  Learning how to collaborate is *as* important as learning how to code.  That means learning to learn and teach each other) and external motivations (eg. filed trips, pizza partys, MEET swag if they meet collective goals).

This document will go into more detail on each of these levers.


## IV. Delivery Guidlines
MEETX courses are:
  - High-energy
  - Interactive
  - Collaborative
  - Fun

Both in terms of content and delivery style. 

1. High-Energy
Teachers convey genuine enthusiasm and passion for subjects
Consistently create space to talk about why a certain subject is not just important but awesome (in the truest sense of the word...awe-inspring)
Encourage and reinforce participation
Extra Extra — Passion + Enthusiasm + Energy (never enough)


2. Interactive
-5-min rule: Teachers never speak for more than 5 minutes at a time.  "Popcorning"
-Every 5 minute block should bookend with an 'interactive practice' or other *CFU*
-Use CFUs REGULARLY


3. ALWAYS use names + Personal details 
    - To reinforce positive behavior in front of the class (eg. 'Did everyone hear Laura's insight?  Laura can you repeat?  or Steve can you summarize what Laura said and possibly add?'
    - To gently state need from a student in front of class 'eg. Tommy we need you to wrap up and give your attention to Lisa.'
    - In written curriculum examples (eg. 'Jerry.dance = "true"')
    - In impromptu examples/metaphors (eg. 'Ok let's try another example of real-world functions.  We all know Jerry is an amazing dancer.  Jerry — can you break down the steps of the 'duggy?')
    - To cold call
      - use regular cold-calling to see if people are digesting important concepts and to encourage attentiveness.  "So Jenny,         if I wanted to rename a file from the command line, what would I have to type?"
      - Don't use as a 'gotcha'
      - Identify disengaged (probably lost) students, and cold-call and coach them through the problem.

*CFUs*
Checks for understanding are a key tactic for 
  1. Introducing interacitivty into a lesson
  2. Giving teacher as much 'early signaling' as possible to course correct — either academically or engagement-wise

Examples:
  1. Thumbs
  2. Arm-barometers
  3. Think-pair-share
  4. Turn-to-partner
  5. Cold-calling
  6. Whiteboard display (count of 3)
  7. Peer Instruction
  8. Fist-to-5
  9. Timed Pair Share
  10. The ConcepTest consists of a challenging conceptual question or problem posed in
  multiple-choice format. Students turn to a partner seated nearby and they work together to reach a
  common answer
  for a given amount of time, taking turns (A talks, B listens, then B talks, A listens)

**Avoid** “Does everyone understand?  Cool?  Does that make sense?”


4. Collaborative.  Most exercises are sturcutred to be completed in pairs or in groups.  "Collaborative learning" is emphasized as a value.  Guidelines are issued are to make 'everyone a student, everyone a learner.'

5. Motivating
topical, challenging content
looking for and acknolwedging progress (publicly and privately)

## IV. Content Guidlines

Hooks and hangers — Content structured sequentially with cliffhangers…
Hooks — Clear motivations for why somethign is important, useful, or fun to learn upfront

Content is always
  - interactive
  - question/cliffhanger driven (eg fake tweet lab)
  - hook-forward (ie. make students ask 'how the heck did you do that?  how the heck do I do that too!?'
  - topical (relative to students and interests and current events.  eg. using taylor swift for fake tweet.n 
  - diverse appeal
  - design to complete in pairs or small groups

## V. Who is a MEETx Teacher?

A MEETx teacher is.

### Interview Protocol

Interview minimum two stages.  
- Stage 1:  Team + Pedagogical
- Stage 2: Technical 
- Stage 3: (Optional) Small group lesson + Debug.  Can be incorporated in either of above stages.  

#### Stage 1 Interview Questions 

- Describe one of the best/worst professional situations you’ve ever had. What made it great? (look for evidence of adaptiability, thriving in fast-paced environment, comfort with ambiguity and iteration, thrive in teams, ability to take ownership and intitiative.) </br>
- What was your favorite moment ever in your classroom? (Look for love.  Do their eyes light up when talking about kids?  Does their heart open?  Do they gush?) </br>
- Who is a student you will always remember?  why? (Same as above ^^) </br>
- How do you feel when the minute before you start a lesson? (Look for evidence of ejoyment of craft and performance). </br>
- Tell me about your lesson prep process (should be thorugh and thoughtful) </br>
- Who is the best teacher you’ve ever seen?  why? (Should speak in reverence of fellow educator.  Notice small things and nuance that teacher uses to be succesful in the classroom). </br>
- Who is your favorite teacher ever, why? (Same as above ^^) </br>
- Tell me about a time you were humbled recently (Is this person humble?  Can they be invested in a feedbakc-heavy culture?) </br>
- Tell me about a big idea that you got really wrong (Same as above ^^) </br>


#### Stage 2 Technical
Assign tictactoe in Python or JS.  Give ~ One week to complete.
1. Whatss the first thing you did after you got the challenge.  How did you begin to approach the problem?
2. Walk me through your code.
3. *stop* them on a particular concept — how would you explain an array/dictionary/etc.
4. Walk me through your favorite feature.
5. What woud you build if you had more time.
6. How would you implement a basic AI (offense, defense)
7. Talk about a design decision that had a tradeoff.
